    <h2>Welcome to ReCounter</h2>
    <p>ReCounter is a tool designed to help keep track of encounters in pen-and-paper games. Often encounters require both player and non-player characters to act in a randomized order, which can make it difficult to remember whose turn comes next.</p>
    <p>ReCounter helps with this problem by giving you a maintain a roster of heroes, a bestiary of monsters, design quests (pre-made encounters), and then run them.</p>
    <p>As you've probably noticed, we're still under construction, but you can try out a simplified version by clicking the "Fight!" link above!</p>
